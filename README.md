# CODELEAP TEST 🚀

## Project Description 📋
This project was developed in React using Styled Components. It is a simple network where users can log in with a username, create posts, edit, and delete their own posts, using the @CodeLeap test API. The application uses Redux for state management and interacts with the API to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the posts.

## Features ✨
Login and Logout:<br>Users can log in to the application and log out, ensuring that logging in again is only possible by logging out the username.
Posts: Users can create, edit, and delete posts.
Responsive Interface: The interface is designed to be user-friendly on both mobile and desktop devices.
